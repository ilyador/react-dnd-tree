# Drag and Drop tree with limited nesting.

Built using Atlassian [Beautifu-DND](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) and [@atlaskit/tree](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/core/tree)

This is a useful demo since there are very few real-life examples of @atlaskit/tree out there.
There is an option to make an element not available for dropping regardless of nesting level by setting `container: false` in the tree item object.

Here is a live demo: [https://codesandbox.io/s/react-dnd-4-level-tree-0pdl5](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-dnd-4-level-tree-0pdl5)
